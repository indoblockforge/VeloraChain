# VeloraChain Core Node (Export)
This archive contains a scaffolded VeloraChain core node with:
- Cosmos SDK + Ethermint scaffold
- DEX module (AMM) with LP tokens
- IBC bridge + HTLC cross-chain swaps
- Router (off-chain) service
- Demo docker-compose + Hermes relayer config
- Tests & CI scaffolds

This is a working scaffold and requires further hardening/auditing for production.
